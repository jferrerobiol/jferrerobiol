### Joan Ferrer Obiol - Evolutionary and Ecological Genomics
---
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher working with the University of Milan and the Movecolab (Movement ecology of colonial birds in Italy, https://movecolab.it/). My research interests are in using phylogenomics, comparative genomics and population genomics to learn more about the evolutionary history of birds with a particular interest in seabirds. I am particularly interested in investigating the genetic basis of complex traits such as migratory behaviour in birds combining genomics with ecological data. For an overview of my research you can visit my Google Scholar page: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b0eXJ-oAAAAJ&hl=en
