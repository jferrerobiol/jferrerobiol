### Joan Ferrer Obiol - Evolutionary and Ecological Genomics
---
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher working with the Bird Genoscape Project at Colorado State University (https://www.birdgenoscape.org/). My research interests are in using population genomics and phylogenomics to learn more about the evolutionary history of birds with a particular interest in seabirds. I am particularly interested in investigating local adaptation and the genetic basis of complex traits such as migratory behaviour in birds combining genomics with ecological data. For an overview of my research you can visit my Google Scholar page: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b0eXJ-oAAAAJ&hl=en
